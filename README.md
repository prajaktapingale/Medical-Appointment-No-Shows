# Medical-Appointment-No-Shows :syringe:

Many times people do not show up for a medical appointment. Previous studies have shown that about 25% of the people do not show up. No-show is a loss for doctors since they lose their payments. On the other hand, patients who wanted an appointment as soon as possible were unable to get one. Thus, there are two losses: the financial loss for the doctor and the loss of an appointment for the person in need.

In this project, I have tried to analyze the various reasons for a patient's no show and also built a predictive model to identify whether the person would show up for his next appointment. This project could help clinics and hospitals in understanding what attributes are associated with the individuals who did not show up.
